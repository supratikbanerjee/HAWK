# HAWK-OS
HAWK is an application framework and operating system based on the Linux. It can run on any compatible hardware(SBCs) using its abstraction layer and exposes high level Python based SDK for developers to build applications for UAVs. 

Its goal is to ease the process of application development by providing a SDK which allows for great level of freedom of control. This would increase focus in the development of application logic leaving the redundant job of primary flight control to the OS. 

The primary objective of keeping it open source is to have contribution from community, with the target of building a standard platform for all kinds of Aerial Vehicles in future.
